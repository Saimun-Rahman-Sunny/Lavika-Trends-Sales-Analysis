- **Gender Demographics**: **Men** are the higher-spending customers. Marketing efforts could include campaigns targeted specifically towards the male demographic.

- **Primary Customer Segment**: The **"Adult" Men** group (ages 31-50) is the most valuable customer segment. Marketing content and product selection should be tailored to this group's preferences.
