## Key Insights & Recommendations

Based on the analysis, here are some key findings:

- **Peak Sales Months**: *(Look at your chart. Which months had the highest sales? Write that here.)* The store should plan for higher inventory during these months and run targeted promotions.
- **Gender-based Marketing**: *(Look at your data. Do men or women spend more?)* Marketing campaigns can be tailored to the dominant purchasing gender.
- **Top Performing States**: *(Which states generated the most revenue?)* Marketing efforts and budget should be concentrated on these top-performing states to maximize return on investment.
- **Most Effective Channel**: *(Which channel like Amazon or Myntra had the most sales?)* The store should focus its marketing budget and efforts on the best-performing sales channels.
